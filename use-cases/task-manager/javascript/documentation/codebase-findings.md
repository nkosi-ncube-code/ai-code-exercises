# Project Findings

## Misconceptions Corrected

My initial understanding was that this project was a traditional Node.js backend application. However, it is a standalone Command Line Interface (CLI) tool. While it uses Node.js, it doesn't expose a web server or API in the typical backend sense.

## Important Entry Points and Architectural Patterns

- **Entry Point**: The primary entry point for this application is <mcfile name="cli.js" path="cli.js"></mcfile>. This file uses the `commander` library to define and parse command-line arguments, acting as the main interface for user interaction.
- **Modularity and Separation of Concerns**: The project demonstrates a clear separation of concerns, even for a minimal application. This is achieved by dividing functionalities into distinct files:
    - <mcfile name="cli.js" path="cli.js"></mcfile>: Handles command-line argument parsing and routing to the appropriate application logic.
    - <mcfile name="app.js" path="app.js"></mcfile>: Contains the core business logic for managing tasks (e.g., creating, listing, updating, deleting tasks).
    - <mcfile name="models.js" path="models.js"></mcfile>: Defines the data structures (e.g., `Task` class) used within the application.
    - <mcfile name="storage.js" path="storage.js"></mcfile>: Manages the persistence layer, handling reading from and writing to the `tasks.json` file.

## Key Components and Their Responsibilities

- <mcfile name="cli.js" path="cli.js"></mcfile>:
    - **Responsibility**: Parses command-line arguments and options using `commander`. It defines the various commands available to the user (e.g., `create`, `list`, `status`, `delete`). It then calls the appropriate functions in <mcfile name="app.js" path="app.js"></mcfile> based on the parsed commands.

- <mcfile name="app.js" path="app.js"></mcfile>:
    - **Responsibility**: Contains the main application logic. It orchestrates operations related to tasks, such as adding new tasks, retrieving tasks, updating their status or priority, and filtering them. It interacts with <mcfile name="models.js" path="models.js"></mcfile> for task data structures and <mcfile name="storage.js" path="storage.js"></mcfile> for data persistence.

- <mcfile name="models.js" path="models.js"></mcfile>:
    - **Responsibility**: Defines the `Task` class, which represents the structure of a single task. This includes properties like `id`, `description`, `completed`, `priority`, `dueDate`, and `tags`. It encapsulates the data model for tasks.

- <mcfile name="storage.js" path="storage.js"></mcfile>:
    - **Responsibility**: Handles all file system operations related to storing and retrieving tasks. It reads tasks from and writes tasks to the <mcfile name="tasks.json" path="tasks.json"></mcfile> file. It acts as an abstraction layer for data persistence, ensuring that the rest of the application doesn't need to know the details of how tasks are saved or loaded.

- <mcfile name="tasks.json" path="tasks.json"></mcfile>:
    - **Responsibility**: This file serves as the persistent storage for all tasks created by the application. It's a JSON file where task data is saved and loaded from.

- <mcfile name="package.json" path="package.json"></mcfile>:
    - **Responsibility**: Defines project metadata and lists dependencies. It specifies that the project uses `commander` for command-line parsing and `uuid` for generating unique identifiers for tasks.

- <mcfile name="prompts/understanding_project_structure.md" path="prompts/understanding_project_structure.md"></mcfile>:
    - **Responsibility**: Stores prompt templates, such as the one used for understanding project structure. This directory is for organizing reusable text prompts or documentation templates.
