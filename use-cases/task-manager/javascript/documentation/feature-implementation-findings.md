# Feature Implementation Findings: Task Export to CSV

## 1. Mapping out where in the codebase this new feature would be implemented:

*   **<mcfile name="cli.js" path="cli.js"></mcfile>**: This file will be updated to add a new `export` command using `commander.js`. This command will define the CLI interface for exporting tasks.
*   **<mcfile name="app.js" path="app.js"></mcfile>**: A new function, e.g., `exportTasksToCsv`, will be added to handle the core logic of fetching tasks, formatting them into CSV, and initiating the file write operation. This function will likely interact with `storage.js` to retrieve the tasks.
*   **<mcfile name="storage.js" path="storage.js"></mcfile>**: While `storage.js` primarily handles reading/writing `tasks.json`, a helper function might be added here or in `app.js` to convert the task data into a CSV string. The actual file writing to a `.csv` file will likely use Node.js's built-in `fs` module.

## 2. Related components that would be affected:

*   **`package.json`**: If any new npm packages are required for CSV generation or file handling (though `fs` is built-in), they would be added here.
*   **`tasks.json`**: This file contains the data that will be exported. Its structure will directly influence how the CSV is formatted.

## 3. Outline a plan for how to approach implementing the export feature:

**Step 1: Define the CLI Command in <mcfile name="cli.js" path="cli.js"></mcfile>**

*   Add a new `program.command('export [filename]')` to `cli.js`.
*   Define options for the command, such as `--force` to overwrite an existing file or `--path` to specify an output directory.
*   Call a new function from `app.js` (e.g., `app.exportTasks`) when the command is executed.

**Step 2: Implement Export Logic in <mcfile name="app.js" path="app.js"></mcfile>**

*   Create an `exportTasks` function in `app.js`.
*   Inside this function, load all tasks using `storage.getTasks()`.
*   Transform the array of task objects into a CSV string. This involves:
    *   Extracting headers (e.g., `id`, `description`, `completed`).
    *   Iterating through each task and formatting its properties into a CSV row.
    *   Handling special characters or commas within task descriptions by enclosing them in quotes.
*   Use Node.js's `fs.writeFile` to write the CSV string to the specified `filename`.
*   Add error handling for file writing operations.

**Step 3: (Optional) CSV Formatting Helper**

*   Consider creating a small helper function or module if the CSV formatting logic becomes complex, especially if tasks have varying properties.

**Step 4: Testing**

*   Create unit tests for the `exportTasks` function in `app.js` to ensure correct CSV formatting and file writing.
*   Perform integration tests by running the `cli.js` command to verify the end-to-end functionality.

**Step 5: Documentation**

*   Update the `documentation.md` file to include details about the new `export` command and its usage.
