# Feature Implementation Findings: Task Export to CSV

## 1. Mapping out where in the codebase this new feature would be implemented:

*   **<mcfile name="cli.js" path="cli.js"></mcfile>**: This file will be updated to add a new `export` command using `commander.js`. This command will define the CLI interface for exporting tasks.
*   **<mcfile name="app.js" path="app.js"></mcfile>**: A new function, e.g., `exportTasksToCsv`, will be added to handle the core logic of fetching tasks, formatting them into CSV, and initiating the file write operation. This function will likely interact with `storage.js` to retrieve the tasks.
*   **<mcfile name="storage.js" path="storage.js"></mcfile>**: While `storage.js` primarily handles reading/writing `tasks.json`, a helper function might be added here or in `app.js` to convert the task data into a CSV string. The actual file writing to a `.csv` file will likely use Node.js's built-in `fs` module.

## 2. Related components that would be affected:

*   **`package.json`**: If any new npm packages are required for CSV generation or file handling (though `fs` is built-in), they would be added here.
*   **`tasks.json`**: This file contains the data that will be exported. Its structure will directly influence how the CSV is formatted.

## 3. Outline a plan for how to approach implementing the export feature:

**Step 1: Define the CLI Command in <mcfile name="cli.js" path="cli.js"></mcfile>**

*   Add a new `program.command('export [filename]')` to `cli.js`.
*   Define options for the command, such as `--force` to overwrite an existing file or `--path` to specify an output directory.
*   Call a new function from `app.js` (e.g., `app.exportTasks`) when the command is executed.

**Step 2: Implement Export Logic in <mcfile name="app.js" path="app.js"></mcfile>**

*   Create an `exportTasks` function in `app.js`.
*   Inside this function, load all tasks using `storage.getTasks()`.
*   Transform the array of task objects into a CSV string. This involves:
    *   Extracting headers (e.g., `id`, `description`, `completed`).
    *   Iterating through each task and formatting its properties into a CSV row.
    *   Handling special characters or commas within task descriptions by enclosing them in quotes.
*   Use Node.js's `fs.writeFile` to write the CSV string to the specified `filename`.
*   Add error handling for file writing operations.

**Step 3: (Optional) CSV Formatting Helper**

*   Consider creating a small helper function or module if the CSV formatting logic becomes complex, especially if tasks have varying properties.

**Step 4: Testing**

*   Create unit tests for the `exportTasks` function in `app.js` to ensure correct CSV formatting and file writing.
*   Perform integration tests by running the `cli.js` command to verify the end-to-end functionality.

**Step 5: Documentation**

*   Update the `documentation.md` file to include details about the new `export` command and its usage.

## Initial Search Findings and Hypothesis:

### Initial Search:

I searched the codebase for keywords related to file operations, data transformation, and existing export functionality. The most relevant findings were in <mcfile name="storage.js" path="storage.js"></mcfile> and <mcfile name="app.js" path="app.js"></mcfile>.

*   **<mcfile name="storage.js" path="storage.js"></mcfile>**: This file already demonstrates file system interaction using Node.js's `fs` module (`fs.readFileSync`, `fs.writeFileSync`) and data transformation using `JSON.parse` and `JSON.stringify` for handling `tasks.json`. This indicates that the project has established patterns for reading from and writing to files, which can be leveraged for CSV export.
*   **<mcfile name="app.js" path="app.js"></mcfile>**: This file contains the core application logic and interacts with `storage.js` to manage tasks. It's the central place for business logic.
*   **<mcfile name="cli.js" path="cli.js"></mcfile>**: This file handles command-line argument parsing and acts as the entry point for user commands.

**Search Terms Used:** `fs.`, `.json`, `export`, `parse`, `stringify`, `read`, `write`, `transform`, `util`.

**Files Found with Relevant Code:**
*   <mcfile name="storage.js" path="storage.js"></mcfile>
*   <mcfile name="app.js" path="app.js"></mcfile>
*   <mcfile name="cli.js" path="cli.js"></mcfile>
*   <mcfile name="models.js" path="models.js"></mcfile> (for `module.exports` pattern)

### Hypothesis:

Based on the initial search, the task data export functionality would primarily belong in <mcfile name="app.js" path="app.js"></mcfile> for the core logic and data transformation, and <mcfile name="cli.js" path="cli.js"></mcfile> for defining the command-line interface. <mcfile name="storage.js" path="storage.js"></mcfile> would be utilized to retrieve the existing task data, and its existing `fs` operations provide a good precedent for writing the CSV file.

**Existing components that might need to be modified:**

*   **<mcfile name="cli.js" path="cli.js"></mcfile>**: To add the new `export` command and its options.
*   **<mcfile name="app.js" path="app.js"></mcfile>**: To implement the `exportTasks` function, which will handle fetching tasks, converting them to CSV format, and writing to a file.
*   **<mcfile name="storage.js" path="storage.js"></mcfile>**: While not directly modified for writing CSV, its `getTasks` method will be crucial for retrieving the data to be exported.

The overall structure aligns with the existing modular design, where `cli.js` handles user input, `app.js` manages business logic, and `storage.js` handles data persistence. The new CSV export feature will integrate seamlessly into this pattern.
