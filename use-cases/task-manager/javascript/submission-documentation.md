# Submission: Understanding and Extending the Task Manager

This document summarizes the journey of understanding and proposing an extension to the Task Manager codebase, highlighting the evolution of understanding, key insights from AI prompts, the approach to implementing a new business rule, and strategies for future code exploration.

## 1. Initial vs. Final Understanding of the Task Manager Codebase

**Initial Understanding:**

Upon first encountering the Task Manager codebase, my understanding was primarily superficial. I recognized the presence of files like `app.js`, `cli.js`, `models.js`, and `storage.js`, and could infer their general roles (application logic, command-line interface, data models, and data persistence, respectively). However, the specific interactions between these components, the precise definition of core entities, and the underlying business logic were unclear. For instance, while `Task` was an obvious entity, the nuances of `TaskPriority` and `TaskStatus` as separate enums, and how they were managed by a `TaskManager`, were not immediately apparent.

**Final Understanding:**

Through systematic exploration guided by AI prompts, my understanding has deepened significantly. I now have a clear grasp of:

*   **Core Entities:** <mcsymbol name="Task" filename="models.js" path="c:\Users\lenovo\Desktop\ai-wethinkcode\ai-code-exercises\use-cases\task-manager\javascript\models.js" startline="20" type="class"></mcsymbol>, <mcsymbol name="TaskPriority" filename="models.js" path="c:\Users\lenovo\Desktop\ai-wethinkcode\ai-code-exercises\use-cases\task-manager\javascript\models.js" startline="4" type="class"></mcsymbol>, <mcsymbol name="TaskStatus" filename="models.js" path="c:\Users\lenovo\Desktop\ai-wethinkcode\ai-code-exercises\use-cases\task-manager\javascript\models.js" startline="10" type="class"></mcsymbol> (defined in <mcfile name="models.js" path="c:\Users\lenovo\Desktop\ai-wethinkcode\ai-code-exercises\use-cases\task-manager\javascript\models.js"></mcfile>), <mcsymbol name="TaskManager" filename="app.js" path="c:\Users\lenovo\Desktop\ai-wethinkcode\ai-code-exercises\use-cases\task-manager\javascript\app.js" startline="1" type="class"></mcsymbol> (in <mcfile name="app.js" path="c:\Users\lenovo\Desktop\ai-wethinkcode\ai-code-exercises\use-cases\task-manager\javascript\app.js"></mcfile>), and `TaskStorage` (in <mcfile name="storage.js" path="c:\Users\lenovo\Desktop\ai-wethinkcode\ai-code-exercises\use-cases\task-manager\javascript\storage.js"></mcfile>).
*   **Business Logic:** How tasks are created, updated, listed, and persisted. The role of `TaskManager` as the central orchestrator of business operations, delegating persistence to `TaskStorage`.
*   **Application Flow:** The `cli.js` file handles user input and translates it into calls to `TaskManager` methods, which then interact with `models.js` for data structures and `storage.js` for data persistence.
*   **Relationships:** A clear understanding of how `Task` objects utilize `TaskPriority` and `TaskStatus` for their attributes, and how `TaskManager` operates on collections of `Task` objects.

## 2. Most Valuable Insights Gained from Each Prompt

Each AI prompt served a crucial role in building this comprehensive understanding:

*   **Initial Codebase Exploration (`feature-implementation-findings.md`):** This prompt forced a high-level overview, identifying key files and their probable responsibilities. It provided the initial scaffolding for understanding where different parts of the application resided.
*   **Domain Model Understanding (`domain-model-findings.md`):** This was arguably the most valuable prompt. By explicitly asking to identify core entities, business logic, and terminology, and then sketching a diagram, it compelled a deep dive into the conceptual heart of the application. The iterative process of defining, questioning, and refining the domain model (with the AI acting as a senior developer) solidified my understanding of the relationships and purpose of each component. The distinction between `Task` as a data structure and `TaskManager` as the operational logic became very clear.
*   **"Senior Developer" Role-Play:** The AI's responses in this role were invaluable for validating my understanding, clarifying ambiguities (e.g., the purpose of `Task.id`, advantages of separate enums), and connecting abstract models to concrete user-facing features. The questions posed by the AI helped test and reinforce the learned concepts.

## 3. Approach to Implementing the New Business Rule (Abandoned Status)

The new business rule requires automatically marking overdue tasks as 'abandoned' unless they are high priority. My approach, informed by the domain modeling exercise, is as follows:

1.  **Define New Status:** Add `ABANDONED` to the `TaskStatus` enum in <mcfile name="models.js" path="c:\Users\lenovo\Desktop\ai-wethinkcode\ai-code-exercises\use-cases\task-manager\javascript\models.js"></mcfile>. This ensures the new state is formally recognized within the domain.
2.  **Add `markAsAbandoned` Method:** Introduce a `markAsAbandoned` method to the <mcsymbol name="Task" filename="models.js" path="c:\Users\lenovo\Desktop\ai-wethinkcode\ai-code-exercises\use-cases\task-manager\javascript\models.js" startline="20" type="class"></mcsymbol> class in <mcfile name="models.js" path="c:\Users\lenovo\Desktop\ai-wethinkcode\ai-code-exercises\use-cases\task-manager\javascript\models.js"></mcfile>. This encapsulates the state change logic within the `Task` entity itself.
3.  **Implement Business Logic in `TaskManager`:** Create a `markOverdueAbandonedTasks` method within the <mcsymbol name="TaskManager" filename="app.js" path="c:\Users\lenovo\Desktop\ai-wethinkcode\ai-code-exercises\use-cases\task-manager\javascript\app.js" startline="1" type="class"></mcsymbol> class in <mcfile name="app.js" path="c:\Users\lenovo\Desktop\ai-wethinkcode\ai-code-exercises\use-cases\task-manager\javascript\app.js"></mcfile>. This method will:
    *   Retrieve all tasks from storage (via `TaskStorage`).
    *   Iterate through them, applying the "overdue and not high priority" criteria.
    *   Call `task.markAsAbandoned()` for eligible tasks.
    *   Save the updated tasks back to storage.
4.  **Persistence Handling:** Ensure `storage.js` correctly handles saving and loading tasks with the new `ABANDONED` status. Given it's a string value, this should be straightforward.
5.  **Trigger Mechanism (Open Question):** The primary challenge identified is how to trigger this method in a CLI application. Options include a manual CLI command or external scheduling (e.g., cron job). This requires further discussion with the team.

This structured approach, moving from domain definition to specific implementation points, was directly enabled by the insights gained from the domain modeling phase.

## 4. Strategies for Approaching Unfamiliar Code in the Future

This exercise has helped me develop several effective strategies for tackling unfamiliar codebases:

1.  **Start with High-Level Overview:** Begin by identifying the main directories and files. Try to infer their general purpose and how they might relate to each other. Look for `README` files or existing documentation.
2.  **Identify Core Domain Entities:** Actively seek out the central data structures and their relationships. This is crucial for understanding the "what" of the system. Tools like semantic search and regex can help pinpoint definitions.
3.  **Map Business Logic to Components:** Once entities are understood, identify where the operations on these entities (the "how") are performed. Look for manager classes, service layers, or controllers.
4.  **Trace Application Flow:** Understand how user interactions or external events trigger actions within the codebase. This often involves starting from entry points (e.g., `cli.js` for CLI apps, `main` functions, API endpoints).
5.  **Leverage Existing Documentation (or Create It):** If documentation exists, use it. If not, consider creating small, focused documentation (like `domain-model-findings.md`) as you learn. The act of documenting forces clarity.
6.  **Ask Targeted Questions:** Don't be afraid to ask specific questions about ambiguities. Breaking down complex problems into smaller, answerable questions is key. Role-playing with an AI (or a human mentor) can be very effective.
7.  **Iterative Refinement:** Understanding is rarely a one-shot process. Be prepared to revisit initial assumptions, refine diagrams, and deepen understanding incrementally.
8.  **Consider Deployment/Operational Aspects Early:** As seen with the "trigger mechanism" for the abandoned status, how a feature will be deployed and operated can significantly influence its design. Thinking about this early can prevent rework.

By systematically applying these strategies, I feel much better equipped to navigate and contribute to new and complex codebases in the future.
