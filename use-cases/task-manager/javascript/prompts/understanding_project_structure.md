Prompt 1: Understanding Project Structure and Technology Stack
Prompt Template:
I'm a junior developer who just joined this project. I've read the README but still need help understanding the project structure and technology stack.

Here's my current understanding of the project:
- It seems to be a Node JS task manager application
- It appears to use Node JS for the backend
- The folder structure seems to follow the standard Node JS project structure
- It uses npm for package management 
- 

Project structure:
C:\Users\lenovo\Desktop\ai-wethinkcode\ai-code-exercises\use-cases\task-manager\javascript>

Key configuration files:
{
  "dependencies": {
    "commander": "^14.0.0",
    "uuid": "^11.1.0"
  }
}


Could you:
1. Validate my understanding and correct any misconceptions
2. Identify additional key technologies, frameworks, and libraries used
3. Explain what each main folder likely contains and its purpose
4. Point out where the application entry points are located
5. Suggest 3-5 specific questions I should ask my team to deepen my understanding

I'm particularly confused about why we neeced four files as the project is minimal and could be achieved using two files.

After your explanation, could you suggest a small exploration exercise I could do to verify my understanding of the project structure?
Practical Application:
Use when you understand the basic setup but need deeper insight into the project structure
Test your initial assumptions and correct any misconceptions early
Helps identify the technologies you might need to learn more about
Provides context on code organization to navigate the project more effectively
Gives you specific questions to ask your team that will demonstrate engagement
