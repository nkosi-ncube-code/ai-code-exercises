I'd like you to act as a senior developer who deeply understands our codebase's domain model. I'm a junior developer trying to make sense of the business logic and domain concepts in this application.

Here's what I've found in the codebase:
[Paste relevant model/entity classes, database schemas, or data structures]

Based on this code, my current understanding is:
- The system seems to be modeling [your interpretation of what the system represents]
- I think [Entity A] and [Entity B] are related because [your reasoning]
- The [specific field or method] appears to represent [your guess at its business purpose]
- I'm confused about why [specific aspect you don't understand]

Could you, as a senior developer:
1. Validate my current understanding, correcting any misconceptions
2. Help me recognize the core domain concepts represented in this code
3. Explain the relationships between these entities in business terms, not just technical relationships
4. Clarify any domain-specific terminology or patterns I might be missing
5. Help me connect these models to actual user-facing features or business processes

Then, please ask me 3-5 questions that would test my understanding of this domain model. These should be questions that make me think about the business logic, not just the code syntax.

Finally, suggest a simple diagram I could sketch to visualize these relationships that would help solidify my understanding.
