Prompt 2: Finding Feature Implementation Locations
Prompt Template:
I need to work on the "Task Export to CSV" feature in this codebase, but I'm not sure where the code for this feature lives.

My approach so far:
- I've searched for keywords like "export", "CSV", "file write", "data transformation"
- I looked in `app.js`, `storage.js`, and `cli.js` which seemed relevant
- I think the feature might relate to `storage.js` for file operations and `app.js` for business logic, and `cli.js` for command definition.

Project structure:
C:\Users\lenovo\Desktop\ai-wethinkcode\ai-code-exercises\use-cases\task-manager\javascript>

Based on my search, these files might be relevant, but I'm not sure:
- <mcfile name="storage.js" path="storage.js"></mcfile> 

Can you help me:
1. Evaluate my search approach and suggest improvements
2. Identify which files and directories most likely contain the implementation for this feature
3. Suggest specific search terms or patterns that would be more effective
4. Explain what parts of the feature might be located in different areas of the codebase
5. Recommend a step-by-step investigation process to understand the complete feature flow

Also, what questions could I ask myself as I'm exploring the code to ensure I'm on the right track? What specific patterns should I look for to confirm I've found all the relevant parts?

After your guidance, could you give me a small challenge to test my understanding of how to navigate this feature's code?
